Mission
You're building the core sales automation engine for your SaaS product that will help

Your customers are:
●​ B2B SaaS companies wanting to scale outbound sales
●​ Agencies offering sales-as-a-service
●​ Startups looking to validate product-market fit
●​ Sales teams wanting to automate top-of-funnel
Your Task: Build an "AI Sales Agent" that becomes an autonomous SDR - from finding
perfect-fit prospects to having intelligent qualification conversations and booking
meetings with sales-ready leads.
